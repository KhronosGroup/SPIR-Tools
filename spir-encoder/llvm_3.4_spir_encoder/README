spir-encoder
------------
This utility provides a mechanism to produce LLVM bitcode compatible
with the SPIR 1.2 specification when working with recent versions of
LLVM. Specifically, this tool takes a SPIR module generated using LLVM
3.4 and outputs bitcode using LLVM 3.2 encoding. This tool assumes
that the SPIR module is valid, and does not perform any
transformations to the module.


Usage
-----
The encoder is available as a standalone executable for converting
bitcode files on disk, and a library for inclusion into an existing
SPIR generator. The standalone executable (spir-encoder) takes two
arguments: the input bitcode file (an LLVM 3.4 SPIR module), and the
output file path. To use the library, include the header file
llvm/SpirTools/SpirBitcodeWriter.h and link against
libSpirEncoder.a. You can then use the WriteBitcodeToFile_SPIR()
function to produce an LLVM 3.2 encoded SPIR module.

How To Build with LLVM
----------------------
1.clone SPIR-tools repository from https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIR-Tools
2.copy "spir-encoder/llvm_3.4_spir_encoder" directory's content to [llvm3.4-path]/tools/spir-encoder
3.Build LLVM
